## Usage

To run the GUI, you can use the command `python run.py` in the command prompt or terminal. This will launch the graphical user interface of the `pyKeys` package.

Alternatively, you can make the script executable by adding the following line at the top of the file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
```

and then running the command chmod +x run.py on Linux or macOS, then you can run the script by just executing it like a binary file.
